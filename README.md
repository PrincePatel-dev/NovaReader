## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why doesn't PPT preserve formatting?
**A**: Apache POI extracts text content only. For visual formatting, we would need image-based rendering which would significantly increase app size and loading time. The current approach prioritizes speed and simplicity.

### Q: Why is PDF navigation sometimes slow on first view?
**A**: We render at 3x resolution for sharp quality. First-time rendering takes a moment, but cached pages load instantly. This is a deliberate trade-off for better quality.

### Q: Does the app work offline?
**A**: Yes! NovaReader works completely offline. All processing is done locally on your device.

### Q: What file formats are supported?
**A**: 
- PDF: All standard PDFs
- PowerPoint: PPT and PPTX

### Q: How much storage does the app use?
**A**: 
- App size: ~13 MB
- Runtime cache: ~20-50 MB (for page caching)
- Total: Less than 100 MB
